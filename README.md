Crypteron CloudMedic
--------------------

## Introduction

CloudMedic is a fully open-sourced medical application connecting:
* Patients
* Doctors
* Nurses
* Family
* Prescriptions 

CloudMedic's mission is to **accelerate innovations and security in Healthcare IT**. It does so by covering infrastructure and security out of the box while also implementing the most common workflows. And best of all, the total control offered as an open source solution makes customizations or integrations extremely easy.

This is the ASP.NET back-end for CloudMedic. Note that there is also an open-sourced AngularJS front-end at this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/crypteron/cloudmedic-angular) that you'll need for a complete solution.

A bootstrapped healthcare app by Crypteron for our fans and customers. Secured by CipherDB and CipherStor.
